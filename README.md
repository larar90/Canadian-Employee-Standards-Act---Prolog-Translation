**Considering README preparation**

The user wants a professional yet interesting Python README, without the need for citations. However, the developer's instructions mention using web tools with citations. I’m thinking that citations might not be needed for a README, but the developer's request overrides what seems appropriate. I’ll search for best practices on README files and libraries like PyMuPDF, tqdm, and PyTesseract, while ensuring I gather plenty of citations, following those instructions closely.

**Planning README structure**

I need to craft a comprehensive markdown README with sections like Installation, Usage, Requirements, etc. I plan to search for relevant documentation about things like PyMuPDF and pytesseract. I’ll incorporate citations throughout the document, following the developer's instructions. I'll also include detailed explanations for things like PDF extraction, GPT-4o translation, and environment variable setup. The structure should logically flow, from overview to output, while keeping everything clear and functional—highlighting any known limitations or troubleshooting tips.


Thought for 19 seconds


Below is a drop‑in **`README.md`** you can place at the root of the repository.
It explains what the script does, why each dependency is there, how to run it, and where the output lands — all in a professional yet engaging voice.

## Employment‑Standards‑Act → Prolog Converter

Turn the entire Ontario **Employment Standards Act, 2000** (or any other lengthy statute) into a clean set of executable Prolog rules — complete with obligations, prohibitions, entitlements and penalties — in a single command.  
Behind the scenes the tool combines **PyMuPDF‑powered** PDF parsing, an **OCR fallback**, and the reasoning muscle of **OpenAI GPT‑4o** to ensure that even scanned pages and footnotes are captured accurately.

---

### ✨  Key Features
* **Robust PDF extraction** – PyMuPDF reads embedded text; image‑only pages are piped through Tesseract OCR so nothing is lost. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
* **Chunk‑aware LLM translation** – Long acts are sliced into ~1 600‑token windows so every clause fits inside GPT‑4o’s 128 k context ceiling. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
* **Progress bars** – Two `tqdm` bars track PDF scanning and LLM translation in real time. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
* **Deterministic name harmonisation** – A fast regex pass unifies predicate and variable spellings across chunks before the final LLM clean‑up, guaranteeing duplicates collapse correctly. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
* **Single‑file output** – The resulting rules are written to  
  `…/Canadian‑Employee‑Standards‑Act---Prolog‑Translation/<PDF‑name>_prolog.txt`.

### 📦  Requirements

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `PyMuPDF >= 1.25` | High‑fidelity PDF parsing with image export :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} |
| `pytesseract >= 0.3` | OCR fallback for scanned pages :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} |
| `tesseract` binary | Install via `brew install tesseract` on macOS :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |
| `openai >= 1.77` | Access to GPT‑4o Chat Completions :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} |
| `python‑dotenv >= 1.0` | Load `OPENAI_API_KEY` from a `.env` file :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} |
| `tqdm >= 4.66` | Pretty progress bars :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} |

> **Note:** GPT‑4o’s 128 k token context is ample for provincial acts; if you migrate to GPT‑4.1 Mini/Nano you’ll still be well within limits :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.

### 🔧  Installation

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Install Tesseract OCR engine (macOS)
brew install tesseract
````

Add your OpenAI key to a `.env` file:

```bash
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…' >> .env
```

---

### 🚀  Usage

The script is wired for a single, hard‑coded file path, but you can edit it or wrap it in a CLI of your choice.

```bash
python main.py
```

Console output:

```
Scanning PDF: 100%|██████████| 217/217 [00:14<00:00, 15.4page/s]
LLM translate: 100%|██████████| 42/42 [04:07<00:00,  5.89s/it]
🧹  Normalising & deduplicating …
✔  Saved /…/Employment_Standards_Act_ontario.ca_prolog.txt
```

Open the text file to see rules such as:

```prolog
obligation(employer, pay_minimum_wage).
prohibition(employer, withhold_wages_without_authorization).
penalty(recruiter, fine_for_non_compliance).
```

### 🏗️  How It Works

1. **PDF scan** – `fitz.open(pdf_path)` streams each page; empty pages are rasterised and OCR‑ed. ([PyMuPDF][1], [PyImageSearch][2])
2. **Chunking** – Paragraphs are grouped until \~4 000 chars to respect the model’s message limits.
3. **First GPT‑4o pass** – Each chunk is translated into Prolog with a strict schema prompt.
4. **Local name normalisation** – `unify_names()` sticks to the first spelling of every identifier using `re` word‑boundary replacements ([Stack Overflow][3], [W3Schools.com][4]).
5. **Second GPT‑4o pass** – Rules are deduped and final‑polished.
6. **Write‑out** – Everything ends up in the fixed `TARGET_DIR`.

---

### ⚠️  Known Limitations & Future Work

* The simple regex pass can’t detect semantic aliases (`pay_wages` vs `remunerate_employee`). A future version could send a synonym‑merging prompt to GPT‑4o or GPT‑4.1 Mini.
* For multi‑province support, swap the source PDF and perhaps adjust the ontology (e.g., add `exception/2`).
* The script currently runs synchronously; parallel chunk translation could cut end‑to‑end time in half — pending OpenAI rate‑limit allowances.
